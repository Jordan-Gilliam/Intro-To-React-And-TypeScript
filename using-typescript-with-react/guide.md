# Using TypeScript with React

1. Open the `my-app` project. Run `yarn start` or `npm run start` to verify
   things are working as expected.

   more protection against type errors and more clarity about what types are
   being used.

Open `my-app/tsconfig.json` and update the areas with a '#TODO' comment.
